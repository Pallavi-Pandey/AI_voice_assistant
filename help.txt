# LiveKit Import Fix

## Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'livekit.agents.multimodal'
```

## Fixes

1. In agent.py:
   - Changed: `from livekit.agents.multimodal import MultimodalAgent`
   - To: `from livekit.agents import Agent` and `MultimodalAgent = Agent`

2. In api.py:
   - Changed: `class AssistantFuc(llm.FunctionContext)`
   - To: `class AssistantFuc(llm.FunctionTool)`

After these changes, the application runs successfully.

## Required Packages

No additional packages are needed. The issue was related to incorrect import paths, not missing packages. The requirements.txt file already contains all necessary dependencies
